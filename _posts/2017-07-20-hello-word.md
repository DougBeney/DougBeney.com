Once upon a time, in May of 2016, I launched my very first eBook, The DIY MIDI Controller Bible, to a list of around 2,500.

In the first day of launching, I sold 34 eBooks for $49.99 each, earning $1359.66.

**Not a bad achievement if I may say so myself.**

This post is my attempt at breaking down everything I learned along the way, from choosing a market, to writing and formatting an eBook, to launching it.

I really hope you get some insane value out of this post. This is the first article of, hopefully, many I will be posting to Cloud Living.

How to Choose a Topic
Choosing a good, marketable, topic is important, but not as important as market testing.

Many people get stuck on picking a topic. They keep looking for “hot” niches and trends to monetize without even considering the skills they already know.

I want to make it clear that I didn’t spend hours of my time in white boarding sessions trying to formulate the perfect eBook topic.
